Currently contains three Chocobo mounts (regular, black, and gold).

The Chocobo Whistle and Sylkis Greens drop from all enemies (hostle, non-critter, non-statue). Zeio Nut drops from all bosses at a low chance.

The Black Chocobo Whistle is crafted from two regular whistles and 100 Sylkis Greens. The Gold Chocobo Whistle is crafted from a Chocobo Whistle, a Black Chocobo Whistle, 100 Sylkis Greens, and a Zeio Nut.
